            Art does not exist to satisfy the mere “L’art pour l’art”. Art
            facilitates people’s lives. Art has the power to enter their minds and
            souls and to trigger growth in people and community in general. This
            is the core of the concept of our work. US-INDIA Art and Culture
            Exchange Center facilitates the growth of enterprises and ideas for
            more than a decade. There is no better way of conveying the story than
            through artwork.

            Sculpture segment.

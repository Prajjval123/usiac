Full-stack development makes it very straightforward to adapt to changing requirements as the engineer understands the complete flow of your application. This also includes the integration of various third-party services like payment gateways, social networks, business analytics, search engine optimization tools.\n Our services include all types of frameworks and tools such as MEAN and MERN stack as well as .NET Stack. Full-stack development is critical in case you want to develop and deploy your application faster. We specialize in full range technologies which include front-end prototyping to back-end services. While developing the front-end we make sure that the best SEO practices are also taken care of by default. We have experts who create RESTful APIs and specializes in microservices. All this goes hand in hand with the best practices of cloud computing to deploy the applications once the development is completed. Another important aspect when it comes to modern-day web applications is that they are responsive to all screen sizes. We make sure this by keeping our approach to be mobile-first. We deliver a superior user experience by following agile methodology.\n We follow the best development and coding practices to make sure that the code we have written is highly optimized. Also, the back-end we develop for your application would be highly secure, stable, and easily scalable. We make sure that we have multi-layered security protocols between the services and the database. We sit with you to understand the business logic, which is the heart of any application, and we make sure that our solution is centred around this logic. We craft a front-end that is easy to use and beautifully blended with a back-end that is secure, stable, and fast. We have robust QA protocols in place to make sure that there are no production defects leaking. All this is worthless until we can deliver our projects on time and we make it our duty to deliver your projects on time.

As more and more organizations venture into this novel technology system, there are many benefits of a vastly improved management of organization resourcesGIS has the capability of linking data sets in order of geographical locations and, therefore, the system facilitates the sharing of inter-department communication and information which in turn leads to better productivity. GIS mapping is among the first steps in this process.\n It is a procedure of collecting data about objects in the space, which necessarily involves recording the geographical position of the object (x and y coordinates)This is why GIS mapping is a very important aspect of GIS that we at ORPAX invest in. Today, we have the resources required to provide a fully automated service for all types of projects that require modern GIS analysis and software tools.

            "Watershed analysis is an important and essential tool used in the process of understanding the functions of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the way it process in relation to the landscape scale. The watershed analysis is also used to assess and analyze opportunities in restoring and enhancing those identified processes and related watershed conditions. Assessing these opportunities is not a task that can be conducted by laymen. The entire process calls for proper and detailed understanding of the way humans have so far reacted to the watershed concept and to have a clear perception of how they are likely to interact with the watershed concept in the future.\n One of the important tools used in watershed analysis is GIS. When it comes to GIS based service providers, ORPAX is leading the competition with our unique customized solutions and unparalleled in-house expertise that combines resources to create supreme end products for the ultimate satisfaction of all our customers.\n A large number of GIS products such as off the shelf digital information and data like digital line graphs, forest service cartographic features and files, digital elevation models, digital soil surveys etc are useful in providing a basis for the analysis.\n The watershed analysis is a resource evaluation report broken down in to various modules and sections including surface erosion, mass wasting, riparian function, stream channel, hydrology, prescriptions and casual mechanisms. The document would contain a series of maps including statistics obtained from the GIS database. ORPAX offers a wealth of analytical tools that are competently suited for the watershed analysis work.\n Whether your objective is to restore, mitigate or protect and environmental asset, we have the capability of helping you with an optimum solution. Typical project goals comprise of enhancing and preserving the value of natural resources as well as integrating the environmental assets with current and forecast development plans. ORPAX offers an extensive range of services to back the process of environmental compliance and related projects such as stream restoration, mine reclamations and hydraulic studies etc. Our competent team has ample experience and professional knowledge for designing a variety of watershed project components as well as the expertise needed for providing the engineering support during construction work process.\n We have aligned our goals with a universal aim of creating a world of value and difference.

With advancements made in sensor technology systems, it is now possible to conduct earth imaging tasks at an exceptional level of detail. With the advent of the new generation multi sensor system it has also invoked a new era for image processing thereby making room for the opportunity of integrating information and data from diverse sensor systems. Typically a remote sensing system would enable a consistent and repetitive view of the earth. This is most important to the process of observing the Earth system and consequences of human activities on earth.\n When it comes to image processing we can provide you with high quality services of transferring raw data and information in to meaningful and useful information. With our image processing services you can access digital image based data with an enhanced and easily analyzable output. The output can be requested in either grey scale or color format as per client's need.\n We are consistently leveraging our position as a leading service provider of remote sensing technologies and image processing tasks to integrate a wide range of geospatial expertise to our customers. From data capture systems, radar sensors to other advanced types of geospatial integration and image processing work such as Microsoft mapping and collaboration technologies we at ORPAX will have a solution.\n With our end-to-end systems, customized and innovative solutions which we continuously enhance with our considerable experience in the areas of remote sensing of data capture and optical and radar image processing we help change the way users acquire, visualize, analyze, distribute all types of geospatial information.\n At ORPAX we constantly update and develop operational strategies and uses of remote sensing data to enhance the cost advantages of satellite imagery and the practical application of these systems.

When the US Defense Department initiated this system their sole intention was to use it for various military applications.\n However, in 1980 the benefits of this system were made available for the civilians providing access to users from any part of the world on a 24 hour basis.

                "A GPS satellite has been programmed to circle earth twice within 24 hours and it moves in a precise orbit in order to transmit relevant signals to earth. The GPS receiving points based in various parts of the world absorbs the information and through a process of triangulation calculates the exact location of the user at any given time. A GPS receiver therefore, could compare the time when a particular signal has been transmitted by a satellite to the time in which it was received. This time difference will also indicate to the GPS receiver about the distance of the satellite. Similarly with more distance measurements from other satellites, a GPS receiver determines the user's location and transmits this information through a GPS unit's electronic map display.\n ORPAX offers Global Positioning System services with a complete asset management platform that we have developed for the exclusive use of entrepreneurs.
